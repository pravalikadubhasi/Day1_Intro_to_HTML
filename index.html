        <p>Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in the atmosphere that are harmful
            to the health.Modern air pollution include rain gagues .pollution meaurement is largest automated .air pollution is 
            nothing but someone.Theses range from simple absorbent test tubes known as diffusion tubes.</p>
            <h3>Water pollution.</h3>

         <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses.It is 
            usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. 
             Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water Contaminants can come from one of four main sources.
            These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.
            Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems.
            One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted
            water for drinking or irrigation.[3] Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water
            provided by the water resource. </p>
         <h3>Sound Pollution</h3>

         <p>Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it is present nonetheless, both on land and
             under the sea. Noise pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound that affects the health and 
             well-being of humans and other organisms.Sound is measured in decibels. There are many sounds in the environment
             , from rustling leaves (20 to 30 decibels) to a thunderclap (120 decibels) to the wail of a siren (120 to 140 decibels). 
             Sounds that reach 85 decibels or higher can harm a personâ€™s ears. Sound sources that exceed this threshold include
              familiar things, such as power lawn mowers (90 decibels), subway trains (90 to 115 decibels), 
              and loud rock concerts (110 to 120 decibels).</p>
